The production features a clean yet warm and slightly diffused aesthetic, with liberal use of reverb and subtle effects contributing to its overall dreamlike and immersive atmosphere.

Overall, this is a hazy, dream-pop track with ethereal synths, a gentle lo-fi pulse, and breathy, reverbed female vocals that evoke a sense of quiet contemplation.
